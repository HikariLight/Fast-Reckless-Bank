# Fast & Reckless Bank app

My solution for Company Shield's technical test.

I implemented a frontend UI in React.js and Tailwind, and a backend API in Java Spring Boot to allow for the following features:
- Create Account
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Transfer Money from one account to another
